# Transform Photos to Monet Paintings with CycleGANs

Artists like Claude Monet are recognized for the unique styles of their works, such as the unique colour scheme and brush strokes. These are hard to be imitated by normal people, and even for professional painters, it will not be easy to produce a painting whose style is Monet-esque. 

However, thanks to the invention of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and their many variations, Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers can build and train deep learning models to bring an artist's peculiar style to your photos.

## Learning Objectives

- Describe the novelty about CycleGANs
- Understand Cycle Consistency Loss
- Describe the complicated architecture of a CycleGAN
- Gain good practices of training deep learning models
- Implement a pre-trained CycleGAN for image style transfer


## Lessons Learned

CycleGAN uses the additional Cycle Consistency Loss to enforce the forward-backward consistency of the Generators.\
